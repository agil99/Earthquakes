	<h1>Background Information<h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The average number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3 or higher in a year was only 21.
				that has greatly increased to 600+ in 2014 and 1000+ in 2015.</li>
			<li>In response to the sudden and dramatic increase in seismic activity, 
				the United States Geological Survey(USGS) has deployed seismic stations in order 
				to better understand the earthquakes.</li>
			<li>The USGS uses numerical simulations of earth processes to evaluate the relationship 
				between fluid injection and earthquakes, and to predict the effects of new and 
				current injection projects.</li>
			<li>The USGS has the ability to provide an earthquake forecast </li>
